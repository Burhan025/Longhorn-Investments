In this project, I have implemented a custom WordPress theme using Genesis Framework, enhancing functionality with custom widgets, AMP support, shortcodes, DNS prefetching, SEO improvements, and WooCommerce compatibility. Added advanced navigation, responsive layouts, custom footer, breadcrumbs, and tailored meta support for mobile.
